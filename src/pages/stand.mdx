# Stand
<!--
This page contains only content that has the tag **stand and pledge**.

This works thanks to this code:

```jsx
<FeedItems filterByTags={['stand']} />
```

More about the `FeedItems` component in the docs: [gatsby-theme-chronoblog#feeditems-component](https://github.com/Chronoblog/gatsby-theme-chronoblog#feeditems-component)

This is convenient for creating pages with your works, portfolio, collecting articles of a certain subject in one place, etc.

If you do not need an extra page, just remove it from `src/pages/`, and remove link to this page from the main menu: `src/gatsby-theme-chronoblog/site-header.mdx`.

## Projects (any content with the "project" tag):

As a society, we don't acknowledge our social-ills, and later, these gets manifested into major problems that we have today! 

As an individual, I will do my best to stand for the cause while trying to address the societal issues around me with appropriate solutions, and strengthen the voice against it.

Also, all the pledges that I take, I will be posting here, for my self-reminder and motivation to continue.
