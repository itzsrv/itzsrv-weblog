**Hey there**, welcome to my weblog. Iâ€™m a software engineer based in INDIA. These days I build webapps with JavaScript. 
A couple years ago it was Java. Here I post my notes, presentations, researches and experiences. 
Basically, this is a web journal for my life journey, and anything that is important for me to document, finds a place here.
