**JVM** requires some memory for its functioning. This memory is consumed from the available memory on host OS. This can be managed programmatically by providing it in startup parameters to jvm. Inside JVM, there exist separate memory spaces **(Heap, Non-Heap, and Cache)** in order to store runtime data and compiled code.

#### Heap Memory

This is the place where objects live. Prior to Java 8, we have Permanent Generation also as part of Heap. But Java 8 onwards, this has been replaced with non-heap memory named as MetaSpace. After Java 8, Heap Space is divided into below two parts:

- #### Young Generation
The young generation is the place where all the new objects are created. When the young generation is filled, garbage collection is performed. This garbage collection is called Minor GC. Young Generation is divided into three parts – **Eden and two Survivor(S1, S2) Memory Spaces**.

  - Most of the newly created objects are located in the Eden memory space. 
  - When Eden space is filled with objects, Minor GC is performed and all the survivor objects are moved to one of the survivor spaces.
  - Minor GC also checks the survivor objects and move them to the other survivor space. So at a time, one of the survivor space is always empty.

- #### Old Generation
Objects that are survived after many cycles of GC, are moved to the Old generation memory space. Usually, it’s done by setting a threshold for the age of the young generation objects before they become eligible to promote to Old generation.

Followings are some JVM memory configurations when running resource-intensive Java programs.
>
- -XmsSetting - initial Heap size
- -Xmn -  size of Young Generation, rest of the space goes for Old Generation.
- -XmxSetting - maximum Heap size
- -XX:NewSizeSetting - new generation heap size
- -XX:MaxNewSizeSetting - maximum New generation heap size
- -XX:MaxPermGenSetting - maximum size of Permanent generation
- -XX:SurvivorRatioSetting - new heap size ratios (e.g. if Young Gen size is 10m and memory switch is –XX:SurvivorRatio=2, then 5m will be reserved for Eden space and 2.5m each for both Survivor spaces, default value = 8)
- -XX:NewRatio - providing ratio of Old/New Gen sizes (default value = 2)


#### Non Heap Memory
The memory that doesn't belong to Heap Area, is informally referred as Non-Heap Memory. This area includes **Stack** and **MetaSpace**.


- #### Stack
This memory is used for execution of a thread and it contains method specific values and references to other objects in Heap.

- #### MetaSpace

  From Java 8 onwards, Permanent Generation has been replaced with MetaSpace, which is a non-heap memory. MetaSpace holds the reflective data of JVM itself, like Class Loader related data, Class metadata, methods and more.

  MetaSpace is not a contiguous memory and can auto increase its size up to the limit that underlying OS allows, whereas Perm Gen always has a fixed maximum size. As long as the classloader is alive, the metadata remains alive in the Metaspace and can’t be freed.

#### Code Cache

  Code Cache is cache memory, that is used for the storage of compiled native codes generated by JIT compiler, JVM internal structures, loaded profiler agent code and data, etc.

#### Garbage Collection

Unlike languages like C, C++, where developers have to take care of the memory management of their programs on their own, Java has feature of automatic memory management, called as **Garbage Collection**. 

Its a thread running in the background that looks into all the objects in the memory and find out objects that are not referenced by any part of the program. All these unreferenced objects are marked and deleted and space is reclaimed for allocation to other objects.

Garbage Collection is Generational and we have **Young Generation**, where it is being referred to as minor Garbage Collection and **Old Generation**, where the full Garbage Collection happens.

Full Garbage collection is more expensive in terms of resources, as deleting live objects from Old Generation requires more efforts and is slow, compared to deleting unreferenced objects from Young Generation.

#### Garbage Collection Types

There are five types of garbage collection that we can use in our applications. We just need to use the JVM switch to enable the garbage collection strategy for the application. Let’s look at each of them one by one.

- **Serial GC (-XX:+UseSerialGC):** Serial GC uses the simple mark-sweep-compact approach for young and old generations garbage collection i.e Minor and Major GC.Serial GC is useful in client machines such as our simple stand-alone applications and machines with smaller CPU. It is good for small applications with low memory footprint.

- **Parallel GC (-XX:+UseParallelGC):** Parallel GC is same as Serial GC except that is spawns N threads for young generation garbage collection where N is the number of CPU cores in the system. We can control the number of threads using -XX:ParallelGCThreads=n JVM option.Parallel Garbage Collector is also called throughput collector because it uses multiple CPUs to speed up the GC performance. Parallel GC uses a single thread for Old Generation garbage collection.

- **Parallel Old GC (-XX:+UseParallelOldGC):** This is same as Parallel GC except that it uses multiple threads for both Young Generation and Old Generation garbage collection.

- **Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector (-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC):** CMS Collector is also referred as concurrent low pause collector. It does the garbage collection for the Old generation. CMS collector tries to minimize the pauses due to garbage collection by doing most of the garbage collection work concurrently with the application threads.CMS collector on the young generation uses the same algorithm as that of the parallel collector. This garbage collector is suitable for responsive applications where we can’t afford longer pause times. We can limit the number of threads in CMS collector using -XX:ParallelCMSThreads=n JVM option.

- **G1 Garbage Collector (-XX:+UseG1GC):** The Garbage First or G1 garbage collector is available from Java 7 and its long term goal is to replace the CMS collector. The G1 collector is a parallel, concurrent, and incrementally compacting low-pause garbage collector.Garbage First Collector doesn’t work like other collectors and there is no concept of Young and Old generation space. It divides the heap space into multiple equal-sized heap regions. When a garbage collection is invoked, it first collects the region with lesser live data, hence “Garbage First”. You can find more details about it at Garbage-First Collector Oracle Documentation.

Full Garbage Collections are **“Stop the World”** events because all application threads are stopped until the operation completes.
