Before learning any Programming Language, I believe every programmer must understand Operating System. Any program, may it be written in C, Java, Python or any other Programming Language, after writing the syntactical pieces of code, we need to run it. And to run a program, we need an Operating System. So a Good Knowledge of Operating System is a must!
And RedHat Enterprise Linux is one great flavour of Linux Operating System to start with. It is widely used in Software Industries and also provides well organised curriculum to learn and get yourself certified. Their certificates are widely recognised in the industry and you can check thier website for all certificates they are offering at the moment: [redhat.com/en/services/all-certifications-exams](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/all-certifications-exams)
